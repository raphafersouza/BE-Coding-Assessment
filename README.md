# BE-Coding-Assessment

Product and Subscription service: 
The task is to build a data model and a REST-based service implementing the features of the following story in Java using SpringBoot. 

We chose this story as it closely resembles the real ones in our system. 
For us, it is important to understand the way you approach the problem statement and see how you code. To do so, we would like to proceed with the following assessment. 
● In your free time, please implement (code) the REST endpoints for one or two of the user stories defined below. The logic should use SQL in-memory or external databases to CRUD the data. Please do not spend more than 5 hours on this assessment. 
User Story 
As a User, I should be able to select a product from the list and get a subscription plan for the selected product. A user can have only one active subscription per product. AC: 
1. I can fetch a list of products. 
2. I can fetch a single product. 
3. I can buy a subscription for a single product. 
4. I can fetch the following information related to my subscription (e.g. start date, end date, duration of the subscription, price, product). 
5. I can pause and resume my subscription. 
6. I can cancel my active subscription. 
Optional Story For Implementation 
As a User, I should be able to use a voucher code to buy products with a discounted price (fixed amount and percentage discount) 
AC: 
1. I can list products with an individual voucher. 
2. I can buy a product with a voucher. 
3. A validation for the voucher should be in place. 
4. A subscription plan is created with a discounted price. 
Once done with the implementation, please provide us the link to the Git repository of your project with the details on how to run the SpringBoot application.
